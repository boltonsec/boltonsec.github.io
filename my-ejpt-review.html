              <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>For quite sometime I've been wanting to do a hands-on security certification.  I researched different practical certifications and decided to do the <a href="https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ejpt/">eJPT</a>.  I spent $300 for the PTS (Penetration Testing Student) full course which includes an exam voucher.  I highly recommend saving money and getting the full package over the elite.  The elite package gives you 60 hours of lab time, but I found that the 30 hours of lab time that the full package gives you is more than enough.</p>
<h3>Course</h3>
<p>The PTS course includes slides, videos, and labs.  Each sections you go through you start with the slides which are pretty basic and then watch a more detailed video.  At the end of the section you get to practice what you learned in the labs.  The labs were the best part of the class.  Everything is already setup for you in the lab.  I love that you can start learning right away with out having to waste hours setting up your own environment.  After completing the course you will be ready to take the eJPT certification exam.  </p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>I couldn't find any problems with the content in the PTS course.  All of the information was up-to-date and relevant.  In the course you will learn many powerful tools like nmap, burp, wireshark, sqlmap and metasploit.  The course does just scratch the surface of all the different subjects that it covers, but that is to be expected since it is for beginners.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you are looking to do a beginner security certification then this one is the best one to get.  It is still not well known to HR, but I think that this certification is going to become more popular.  The information that I learned in this course was invaluable.</p>
